Ant targets: clean, compile, run

Compiles properly
Runs properly, screen a little too large. Can't read the text to the right as the grid covers the entire screen This is listed in the issues as a resolution problem. 

A start menu, as listed as a possible thing to add in the issues section, may help with the above, although it's possible jframe is being used and being initialized at a fixed size that does not scale down based on resolution of the monitor. 

No save/load functionality, as listed in the issues. No option to restart either. 

NEW ISSUE: Listed in the rules is the ability of a player to choose to pass their turn. There is currently no option for a player to pass their turn. Both players choosing to pass means the game ends. This likely would not be too difficult to add. 

Scoring is based solely on number of tiles owned by each color. According to the wikipedia page of the game Go, scoring is a lot more complicated than that and based on area that pieces enclose as well. The game does not hold functionality for this kind of scoring yet, and this is mentioned in the readme and the issues. 

Mentioned in the readme/issues, one is not allowed to place a piece in a place that would cause it to immediately be captured. Normally this is good, but there is an exception that if placing the piece there would take another piece that would result in it having a liberty, then this would be an acceptable move. However, adding this exception would require adding the "ko" rule to the game as well, which states that one is not allowed to place a piece in the same spot a piece was just taken to eliminate the piece just placed to prevent continuing the game perpetually. 

NEW ISSUE: According to the rules, the Black player is supposed to make the first move. In this game, the White player makes the first move. 

NEW ISSUE: Go is a really complicated game, perhaps adding a tutorial mode would help ease new players in to the game, using the text box on the right to explain what is going on and the strategy involved.
