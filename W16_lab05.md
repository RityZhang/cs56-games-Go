a.
The project is making a game of GO that can be played with two human players.

b.
As a player, I can click a tile and make it change color so that I can gain points.
As a player, I can click the directions button so that I can learn how to play the game.

c.
The software runs. You can click on a tile and that changes the tile's color. The captures work to a certain extent. Each move updates the score. There is a surrender button and a direction button. The direction button opens a new window that contains the directions to playing the game.

d.
Some typos/misspellings. The README can be improved by including the directions text.
